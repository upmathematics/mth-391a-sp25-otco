### Help Hours Guidelines

It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three recommendations before you come in:

  * List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one by one.
  * Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant materials.
  * Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the strategies you have tried.

Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an appointment.

### Collaboration Policy

I expect you to participate in the class through lectures, class activities, discussions, homework, and other engagements. I also expect you to make use of opportunities to get help outside of class (help hours, Teams, email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the most helpful so I know how I can best help you.

> You are encouraged to participate in discussions with your peers regarding assignments. However, each student must take responsibility and ownership of their work and submit their work individually, except for group projects.

> You must submit your mini-assignment individually by end-of-class or end-of-day. Your name must exist in your assignment and the names of your collaborators.

Mini-assignments are marked mostly on completion, and partially on correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no detailed feedback on worksheets, and no opportunities for revisions and make-up.

### Project Phases and Milestones

Completing a data science project is essential for learning data science concepts because it provides practical application and experience. This course's main assessments is through a semester-long project and it will be divided into phases and milestones.

##### Project Phases

The purpose of the project phases is to break the semester-long project into smaller tasks, allowing for incremental progress toward its completion. Project phase reports must be communicated on the next scheduled phase. The reports should consist of a concise 3-minute presentation supported by three well-designed slides. These presentations should effectively summarize the following key elements:

  * **Tasks:** Clearly articulate the tasks and purpose in relation to the overall project objectives. This includes outlining the problem being addressed, the motivation behind the work, and the specific outcomes that are being targeted.
  * **Progress Achieved:** Provide a brief overview of the work completed so far, highlighting key results, and any challenges you overcame. This section should demonstrate the current state of the project.
  * **Next Tasks:** Outline the next steps to be taken, focusing on the remaining tasks towards the next project milestone. Additionally, this section can include any anticipated hurdles and potential contingency plans.

Each slide should focus on one of these three components, with clear and concise content. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, or images, should be used to enhance understanding and engage the audience. Presenters should aim for a professional delivery that stays within the 3-minute time limit, ensuring clarity and impact without overloading the audience with excessive details.

##### Project Milestones

The milestones are aligned with key stages of the data science life cycle to ensure the systematic and effective progression of projects. Each milestone represents a distinct project phase and serves as a checkpoint to verify alignment with objectives and address potential challenges.

Each milestone includes a written report and reflects the expectations of a typical project phase. The following are details on what these milestones should be:

* **Project Proposal:** Frame your data science project, establish objectives, and outline the approach to solving it. Requirements:
    - Clearly define the problem or research question.
    - Specify the dataset(s) to be used and their relevance.
    - Outline the methods or techniques to be employed (e.g., exploratory data analysis, modeling, visualization).
    
* **1st Progress Report:** Summarize early work on data acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis. Requirements:
    - Description of datasets obtained, including sources and key features.
    - Initial data cleaning steps (e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates).
    - Preliminary insights from data exploration (e.g., summary statistics, visualizations).
    - Updates on challenges encountered (e.g., data quality issues) and resolutions.
    
* **2nd Progress Report:** Focus on finalizing data visualizations, exploratory analyses, and refining data preparation, with modeling as a secondary consideration. Requirements:
    - Comprehensive set of data visualizations that clearly convey trends, patterns, and key insights.
    - Advanced exploratory analyses, including correlations, feature engineering, or hypothesis testing.
    - Validation of the dataset's readiness for modeling (e.g., addressing imbalances, normalization, feature selection).
    - Initial modeling attempts, with a focus on establishing a baseline or proof-of-concept models rather than optimization.
    - Discussion of insights derived from visualizations and how they influence modeling decisions.

* **Final Report:** Deliver a comprehensive document summarizing the entire data science project, from problem definition to final insights. Requirements:
    - Overview of objectives and methods.
    - Detailed findings, including final model performance and validation results.
    - Key insights drawn from analyses, supported by visualizations.
    - Discussion of the project’s impact, limitations, and potential future work.

* **Project Presentation:** Summarize and showcase the project’s objectives, process, findings, and conclusions in a concise, engaging format. Requirements:
    - A 15-minute presentation with 10 well-designed slides.
    - Visuals summarizing data insights, modeling approach, and final outcomes.
    - Focused delivery with clear, jargon-free communication for a mixed audience.

## **Expectations**

### Deadline Extension Policy

If you need more time to submit an assignment, you may request an extension by following these steps:

  * Communicate with me at least 12 hours before the deadline.
  * Specify the exact day you plan to submit your work or the number of extra days you need.
  * Please ensure that you adhere to the established timeline for submitting assignments, as it is important to maintain fairness and avoid over-reliance on extensions.

Submitting a few hours late is usually not a major issue, as long as I receive your work before I begin marking and providing feedback. An extension is not required in such cases. Extensions for in-class assignments --such as worksheets, mini-assignments, or activities-- will only be granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire class.

*Amendment 6: The sentence "If you need more time to submit a homework assignment, you may request an extension by following these steps:" was changed to "If you need more time to submit an assignment, you may request an extension by following these steps:".*

*Amendment 7: The sentence "Extensions for worksheets will only be granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire class." was changed to "Extensions for in-class assignments --such as worksheets, mini-assignments, or activities-- will only be granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire class."*

### Late Assignments

You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time. Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let me know if you have missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior communication regarding extensions. Because every assignment is an important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully helping you learn from this course.

*Amendment 8: The "Late Assignments" subsection was moved.*

*Amendment 9: The sentence "Please let me know if you are unable to submit your work and have missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date." was modified to "Please let me know if you have missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior communication regarding extensions."*

### Withdrawal Procedures

It is the student's responsibility to drop the course if he or she is no longer planning on attending the course or filling the other course requirements. In order to drop, the student must use and Add/Drop form available at the Registration Office. If a student does not properly withdraw from a course, he or she may receive an **F** for the course. A properly withdrawn student will receive a **W**. The last day to withdraw is **Monday, April 14th**.

### Appointment Cancelation Policies

You can cancel your appointments, but it is strongly recommended that you cancel 24 hours before your scheduled time so that other students can schedule when a spot opens. You can reschedule for a different day and time if you need to.

### Absences

Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell should NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible. 

Should the instructor need to miss class, the course may be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the course. 

### Incompletes

An incomplete "I" will only be considered when the quality of a student's work is satisfactory (C- or better), but for some essential reason the course has not been completed by the student. An "I" is reserved for emergency situations only. To request an incomplete, the student must submit a typed, signed and dated letter stating the reason(s) why an incomplete is appropriate. The letter should also contain the conditions for the completion of work. Acceptance of the request shall be at the discretion of the instructor, Department Chair, and/or Dean of the College of Arts \& Sciences.

### Accessibility Statement

The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic Resource Center (503-943-8985). **If you have an AES Accommodation Plan**, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in the course syllabus.

### Code of Academic Integrity

The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity. 

Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at  [https://libguides.up.edu/cite](libguides.up.edu/cite){target="_blank"}.

The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.

Please see the University Bulletin for further information: [up.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2023-2024/bulletin/](http://up.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2022-2023/bulletin/University-Academic-Regulations/I-Code-of-Academic-Integrity/Guidelines-for-Implementation-of-the-Universitys-Code-of-Academic-Integrity){target="_blank"}.

### Course AI Policy

The use of generative AI — such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT — is encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts, acknowledge AI's assistance, protect data privacy, verify information, and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not a replacement for critical thinking.

### Referencing and Citation Guidelines

In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases, or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA or CSE.

  * APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is characterized by parenthetical citations that include the author's last name and the year of publication. For example, "According to Smith (2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5'10"."
  * CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the paper. For example, "[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132."

If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with me. You can also find more information about APA and CSE style in the Clark Library citation guidelines: [libguides.up.edu/cite](https://libguides.up.edu/cite){target="_blank"}

Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work without giving them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work is properly cited.

### Mental Health Statement

Anyone may sometimes experience problems with their mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at UP, please contact the [University of Portland Counseling Center](https://www.up.edu/counceling/){target="_blank"} in the upper level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or [hcc@up.edu](mailto:hcc@up.edu){target="_blank"}. Their services are free and confidential. In addition, confidential phone counseling is available at the Pilot Helpline by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3. The University of Portland Campus Safety Department (503-943-4444) also has personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health emergencies at all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do – for yourself, for those you care about, and for those who care about you. For more information on health and wellness resources at UP go to [https://linktr.ee/wellnessUP](https://linktr.ee/wellnessUP){target="_blank"}.

### Non-Violence Statement

The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal violence, are inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must take a stand against violence. Learn more about what interpersonal violence looks like, campus and community resources, UP’s prevention strategy, and what we as individuals can do to assist on the [Green Dot website](https://www.up.edu/greendot){target="_blank"}, [www.up.edu/greendot](https://www.up.edu/greendot){target="_blank"}. Further information and reporting options may be found on the [Title IX website](https://www.up.edu/titleix){target="_blank"}, [www.up.edu/titleix](https://www.up.edu/titleix){target="_blank"}.

### Ethics of Information

The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information, including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use, information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at [Ethical Use of Information](https://libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse){target="_blank"} at [libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse](https://libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse){target="_blank"}.

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

In the study of natural and mathematical sciences, often perceived as objective disciplines aimed at understanding the world, it is crucial to recognize the historical biases embedded within these fields, stemming from a limited set of privileged populations. Acknowledging the potential existence of overt and covert biases within the course, I emphasize that science is a human endeavor necessitating the incorporation of diverse experiences in the pursuit of knowledge and skill. Valuing every student irrespective of background, origin, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, etc., I am committed to fostering an inclusive climate throughout the course. Encouraging open communication about concerns or challenges, I assure confidentiality, except for instances of academic integrity violations or sexual harassment, which are legally mandated to be reported. Within our classroom, diversity and individual differences are celebrated as strengths, and the use of mathematics as an analytical tool to challenge power, privilege, and oppression is supported. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged while maintaining respect for individuals.
