</div>
<div id="help-hours-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Help Hours Guidelines</h3>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or
set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling
behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to
clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive
during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three
recommendations before you come in:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all
concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one
by one.</li>
<li>Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant
materials.</li>
<li>Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you
have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the
strategies you have tried.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out
of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and
chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for
one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an
appointment.</p>
</div>
<div id="collaboration-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>I expect you to participate in the class through lectures, class
activities, discussions, homework, and other engagements. I also expect
you to make use of opportunities to get help outside of class (help
hours, Teams, email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific
messages are the most helpful so I know how I can best help you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are encouraged to participate in discussions with your peers
regarding assignments. However, each student must take responsibility
and ownership of their work and submit their work individually, except
for group projects.</p>

<h3>Project Phases and Milestones</h3>
<p>Completing a data science project is essential for learning data
science concepts because it provides practical application and
experience. This course’s main assessments is through a semester-long
project and it will be divided into phases and milestones.</p>
<div id="project-phases" class="section level5">
<h5>Project Phases</h5>
<p>The purpose of the project phases is to break the semester-long
project into smaller tasks, allowing for incremental progress toward its
completion. Project phase reports must be communicated on the next
scheduled phase. The reports should consist of a concise 3-minute
presentation supported by three well-designed slides. These
presentations should effectively summarize the following key
elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Clearly articulate the tasks and purpose in
relation to the overall project objectives. This includes outlining the
problem being addressed, the motivation behind the work, and the
specific outcomes that are being targeted.</li>
<li><strong>Progress Achieved:</strong> Provide a brief overview of the
work completed so far, highlighting key results, and any challenges you
overcame. This section should demonstrate the current state of the
project.</li>
<li><strong>Next Tasks:</strong> Outline the next steps to be taken,
focusing on the remaining tasks towards the next project milestone.
Additionally, this section can include any anticipated hurdles and
potential contingency plans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each slide should focus on one of these three components, with clear
and concise content. Visual aids, such as charts, graphs, or images,
should be used to enhance understanding and engage the audience.
Presenters should aim for a professional delivery that stays within the
3-minute time limit, ensuring clarity and impact without overloading the
audience with excessive details.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-milestones" class="section level5">
<h5>Project Milestones</h5>
<p>The milestones are aligned with key stages of the data science life
cycle to ensure the systematic and effective progression of projects.
Each milestone represents a distinct project phase and serves as a
checkpoint to verify alignment with objectives and address potential
challenges.</p>
<p>Each milestone includes a written report and reflects the
expectations of a typical project phase. The following are details on
what these milestones should be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Proposal:</strong> Frame your data science project,
establish objectives, and outline the approach to solving it.
Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Clearly define the problem or research question.</li>
<li>Specify the dataset(s) to be used and their relevance.</li>
<li>Outline the methods or techniques to be employed (e.g., exploratory
data analysis, modeling, visualization).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>1st Progress Report:</strong> Summarize early work on data
acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis. Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Description of datasets obtained, including sources and key
features.</li>
<li>Initial data cleaning steps (e.g., handling missing values, removing
duplicates).</li>
<li>Preliminary insights from data exploration (e.g., summary
statistics, visualizations).</li>
<li>Updates on challenges encountered (e.g., data quality issues) and
resolutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>2nd Progress Report:</strong> Focus on finalizing data
visualizations, exploratory analyses, and refining data preparation,
with modeling as a secondary consideration. Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive set of data visualizations that clearly convey trends,
patterns, and key insights.</li>
<li>Advanced exploratory analyses, including correlations, feature
engineering, or hypothesis testing.</li>
<li>Validation of the dataset’s readiness for modeling (e.g., addressing
imbalances, normalization, feature selection).</li>
<li>Initial modeling attempts, with a focus on establishing a baseline
or proof-of-concept models rather than optimization.</li>
<li>Discussion of insights derived from visualizations and how they
influence modeling decisions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Final Report:</strong> Deliver a comprehensive document
summarizing the entire data science project, from problem definition to
final insights. Requirements:
<ul>
<li>Overview of objectives and methods.</li>
<li>Detailed findings, including final model performance and validation
results.</li>
<li>Key insights drawn from analyses, supported by visualizations.</li>
<li>Discussion of the project’s impact, limitations, and potential
future work.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Project Presentation:</strong> Summarize and showcase the
project’s objectives, process, findings, and conclusions in a concise,
engaging format. Requirements:
<ul>
<li>A 15-minute presentation with 10 well-designed slides.</li>
<li>Visuals summarizing data insights, modeling approach, and final
outcomes.</li>
<li>Focused delivery with clear, jargon-free communication for a mixed
audience.</li>
<li>Participation in reviewing other student’s projects based on
structured criteria (e.g., clarity, analysis quality,
presentation).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The final project presentations are on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section A:</strong> May 1, Th 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM, Franz Hall
125</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div id="project-assessments" class="section level3">
<h3>Project Assessments</h3>
<p>Project reports are marked using the general grading guide and will
be returned with detailed feedback.</p>
<p>There will be no revisions for project phases and milestones because
each phase is designed to include drafting and revising as part of the
process. This semester-long project is intentionally structured to be
iterative.</p>
<div id="assessing-project-reports" class="section level5">
<h5>Assessing Project Reports</h5>

<div id="deadline-extension-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Deadline Extension Policy</h3>
<p>If you need more time to submit an assignment, you may request an
extension by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with me at least 12 hours before the deadline.</li>
<li>Specify the exact day you plan to submit your work or the number of
extra days you need.</li>
<li>Please ensure that you adhere to the established timeline for
submitting assignments, as it is important to maintain fairness and
avoid over-reliance on extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submitting a few hours late is usually not a major issue, as long as
I receive your work before I begin marking and providing feedback. An
extension is not required in such cases. Extensions for in-class
assignments –such as worksheets, mini-assignments, or activities– will
only be granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire
class.</p>

extend the deadline for the entire class.”</em></p>
</div>
<div id="late-assignments" class="section level3">
<h3>Late Assignments</h3>
<p>You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time.
Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time - such
as a medical reason - are understandable. Please let me know if you have
missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior
communication regarding extensions. Because every assignment is an
important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when
you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable
consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully
helping you learn from this course.</p>
<p><em>Amendment 8: The “Late Assignments” subsection was
moved.</em></p>
<p><em>Amendment 9: The sentence “Please let me know if you are unable

<h3>Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services
fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss
with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to
meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a
disability are also encouraged to use the services of the Office for
Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic
Resource Center (503-943-8985). <strong>If you have an AES Accommodation
Plan</strong>, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to
implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for
exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two
weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in
advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your
instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to
ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other
emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or
accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for
completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation
standards specified in the course syllabus.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-of-academic-integrity" class="section level3">
<h3>Code of Academic Integrity</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of
learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and
engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such
pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present
truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that
they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s
assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without
proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.</p>
<p>Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical
responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or
other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit
assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are
original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines
for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the
specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also
maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at <a
href="libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">https://libguides.up.edu/cite</a>.</p>
<p>The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated
as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or
cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI
Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider
appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their
courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not
detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All
members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating
sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work,
upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.</p>
<p>Please see the University Bulletin for further information: <a

<div id="course-ai-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>Course AI Policy</h3>
<p>The use of generative AI — such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT — is
encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must
use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI
responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts,
acknowledge AI’s assistance, protect data privacy, verify information,
and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not
a replacement for critical thinking.</p>
</div>
<div id="referencing-and-citation-guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Referencing and Citation Guidelines</h3>
<p>In your written work for this course, you must cite all sources of
information that you use, whether they are direct quotes, paraphrases,
or summaries. The style of citation that you use should be consistent
throughout your paper. The citation styles for this course are APA or
CSE.</p>
<ul>
<li>APA style is used in the social sciences and psychology. It is
characterized by parenthetical citations that include the author’s last
name and the year of publication. For example, “According to Smith
(2023), the average height of a man in the United States is 5’10”.”</li>
<li>CSE style is used in the natural sciences and engineering. It is
characterized by numbered citations that are listed at the end of the
paper. For example, “[1] Smith, J. (2023). The average height of a man
in the United States. Journal of Human Biology, 55(2), 123-132.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unsure which citation style to use, please consult with
me. You can also find more information about APA and CSE style in the
Clark Library citation guidelines: <a
href="https://libguides.up.edu/cite"
target="_blank">libguides.up.edu/cite</a></p>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else’s work without giving
them credit. It is a serious academic offense that can result in a
failing grade or even expulsion from school. By following these
guidelines, you can help to avoid plagiarism and ensure that your work
is properly cited.</p>

<div id="mental-health-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Mental Health Statement</h3>
<p>Anyone may sometimes experience problems with their mental health
that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily
life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at
UP, please contact the <a href="https://www.up.edu/counceling/"
target="_blank">University of Portland Counseling Center</a> in the
upper level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near
Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or <a href="mailto:hcc@up.edu"

<h3>Non-Violence Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and
respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any
kind, and in particular acts of power-based personal violence, are
inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must

<div id="ethics-of-information" class="section level3">
<h3>Ethics of Information</h3>
<p>The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the
investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and
encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the
whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and
honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the
right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information,
including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use,
information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found
in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at <a

<div id="diversity-and-inclusion-statement" class="section level3">
<h3>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h3>
<p>In the study of natural and mathematical sciences, often perceived as
objective disciplines aimed at understanding the world, it is crucial to
recognize the historical biases embedded within these fields, stemming
from a limited set of privileged populations. Acknowledging the
potential existence of overt and covert biases within the course, I
emphasize that science is a human endeavor necessitating the
incorporation of diverse experiences in the pursuit of knowledge and
skill. Valuing every student irrespective of background, origin, race,
religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability status, etc., I am
committed to fostering an inclusive climate throughout the course.
Encouraging open communication about concerns or challenges, I assure
confidentiality, except for instances of academic integrity violations
or sexual harassment, which are legally mandated to be reported. Within
our classroom, diversity and individual differences are celebrated as
strengths, and the use of mathematics as an analytical tool to challenge
power, privilege, and oppression is supported. It is our collective
responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged
while maintaining respect for individuals.</p>
