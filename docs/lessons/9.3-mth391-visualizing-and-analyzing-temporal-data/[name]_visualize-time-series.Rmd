* Please read the problems fully and carefully before answering.
* When finished, knit this `.Rmd` to `.html`.
* Submit this `.Rmd` and the recently knitted `.html`.

# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(nycflights23)

# bind the two data frames
flights <- nycflights13::flights %>% 
  rbind(nycflights23::flights)
```
