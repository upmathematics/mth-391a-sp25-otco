# Syllabus Reminders

* You must submit your mini-assignment individually by end-of-class or end-of-day. Your name must exist in your mini-assignment and the names of your collaborators.
* Mini-assignments are marked mostly on completion, and partially on correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no detailed feedback on mini-assignments, and no opportunities for revisions and make-up.

# Instructions

* For the exercises, please provide your answers in full sentences.
* Write your answers by replacing the text "[Write your answer here]".
* Please read the problems fully and carefully before answering.
* When finished, knit this `.Rmd` to `.html`.
* Submit this `.Rmd` and the recently knitted `.html`.

# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(usdata)

# mapping related packages
library(maps)
library(usmap)
library(urbnmapr)
library(sf)
```

# Exercises

## Problem 1

we are using the shapefiles provided by the [`urbnmapr`](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/urbnmapr/index.html){target="_blank"} package, which is from the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/){target="_blank"}. For the R code block below, examine the R code and solve the following:

a. Choose a US state to map other than the example.
b. Use the `county` data set from the `usdata` package where you use the `pop_change` variable and convert it into an ordinal categorical variable with 6 levels.
c. Combine the shapefile dataframe and part (b)s dataframe where you match the county and the state names.
d. Plot the county-level state map where you color each county proportional to the ordinal categorical variable done in part (b). Choose a color diverging scheme from [ColorBrewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=PuRd&n=6){target="_blank"}.
e. Use the `us.cites` data set from the `maps` package to put point onto your map.
    
Make sure to adjust your figure widths and heights to avoid distortions or overlapping labels.
Once you draw your map, describe your observations.

```{r message=FALSE}
#### Start: (1) Choose a US State here
state_full <- "California"
state_abv <- "CA"
#### End: (1) Choose a US State here

# Load the shapefile object of US counties and filter only the state of choice
#   using the urbnmapr package
counties_sf <- get_urbn_map("counties", sf = TRUE)
counties_sf_ca <- counties_sf %>% filter(state_name == state_full)
```

```{r state_county_pop_map_2, fig.align='center', out.width="100%", fig.height=7}
#### Start: (2) Wrangle the county data set here
# subset of the county data set
county_sub <- county %>%
  select(name,state,pop_change)
# cities data set
crs_use <- "+proj=laea +lat_0=30 +lon_0=-95" # Albers projection with curvature
us_cities <- us.cities %>%
  mutate(name_n = str_remove_all(name, state_abv)) %>%
  mutate(name_n = str_remove_all(name_n, " ")) %>%
  filter(country.etc == state_abv)
d_points <-  us_cities %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat"), crs = 4326) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = crs_use)
#### End: (2) Wrangle the county data set here

#### Start: (3) Update the ggplot pipeline here
ggplot(data = counties_sf_ca, aes()) + 
  geom_sf() + 
  labs(title = paste("Population Change County-Level Map of",state_full)) +
#### End: (3) Update the ggplot pipeline here
theme(legend.position="bottom",
        panel.background=element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```
