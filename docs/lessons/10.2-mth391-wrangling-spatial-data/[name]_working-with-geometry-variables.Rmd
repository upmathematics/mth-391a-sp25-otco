# Syllabus Reminders

* You must submit your mini-assignment individually by end-of-class or end-of-day. Your name must exist in your mini-assignment and the names of your collaborators.
* Mini-assignments are marked mostly on completion, and partially on correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no detailed feedback on mini-assignments, and no opportunities for revisions and make-up.

# Instructions

* For the exercises, please provide your answers in full sentences.
* Write your answers by replacing the text "[Write your answer here]".
* Please read the problems fully and carefully before answering.
* When finished, knit this `.Rmd` to `.html`.
* Submit this `.Rmd` and the recently knitted `.html`.

# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(usdata)

# mapping related packages

# Exercises

## Problem 1

Below, we demonstrate how to create maps using the `usmap` package. This package is specifically for making US maps for national, state, and county levels. For the R code chunk below, examine the R code and solve the following:

a. Choose a US state to map.
b. Choose a color sequential scheme from [ColorBrewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=PuRd&n=6){target="_blank"}.
    
Make sure to adjust your figure widths and heights to avoid distortions or overlapping labels. Once you draw your map, describe your observations.

```{r}
# New variable where the 2022 population is converted into an 
#   ordinal categorical variable with n levels.
#   Here we are using the countypop dataframe
n_levels <- 6
pop_level <- cut_number(log10(countypop$pop_2022),n_levels)
county_new <- countypop %>% 
  mutate(population = pop_level)

# Map a state with county borders

#### Start: (1) Choose a US State here
state_full <- "California"
state_abrv <- "CA"
#### End: (1) Choose a US State here

plot_usmap(data = county_new, 
           values = "population", 
           include = c(state_abrv)) + # uses the state abbv
  
#### Start: (2) Change color scheme here 
  # number of colors must match number of levels - these are HEX color codes
  scale_fill_manual(values = 
                       c('#ffffcc','#d9f0a3','#addd8e',
                         '#78c679','#31a354','#006837')) + 
#### Start: (2) Change color scheme here
  
  guides(fill=guide_legend(nrow=2,byrow=TRUE)) + 
  labs(fill = "log10(population)",
       title = paste("2022 Population County-Level Map of",state_full)) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Problem 2

Below, we demonstrate another way to map a US state using the `sf` package, which it can extend shapefiles into dataframe-like objects. Here, we are using the shapefiles provided by the [`urbnmapr`](https://urbaninstitute.github.io/urbnmapr/index.html){target="_blank"} package, which is from the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/){target="_blank"}. For the R code chunk below, examine the R code and solve the following:

a. Choose a US state to map other than what you chose in problem 1.
b. Use the `county` data set from the `usdata` package where you use the `unemployment_rate` variable and convert it into an ordinal categorical variable with 6 levels.
c. Combine the shapefile dataframe and part (b)s dataframe where you match the county and the state names.
d. Plot the county-level state map where you color each county proportional to the ordinal categorical variable done in part (b). Choose a color sequential scheme from [ColorBrewer 2.0](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=PuRd&n=6){target="_blank"}.
    
Make sure to adjust your figure widths and heights to avoid distortions or overlapping labels. Once you draw your map, describe your observations.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#### Start: (1) Choose a US State here
state_full <- "California"
#### End: (1) Choose a US State here

# Load the shapefile object of US counties and filter only the state of choice
#   using the urbnmapr package
counties_sf <- get_urbn_map("counties", sf = TRUE)
counties_sf_ca <- counties_sf %>% filter(state_name == state_full)
```

```{r}
#### Start: (2) Wrangle the county data set here
county_sub <- county %>%
  select(name,state,unemployment_rate)
#### End: (2) Wrangle the county data set here

#### Start: (3) Update the ggplot pipeline here
ggplot(data = counties_sf_ca, aes()) + 
  geom_sf() +
  labs(x = "latitude",
       y = "longitude",
#### End: (3) Update the ggplot pipeline here
       title = paste("Unemployment Rate County-Level Map of",state_full))
```

## Problem 3

Below, we demonstrate another way to map a US state, were we use an actual shapefile. For the R code chunk below, examine the R code and solve the following:

a. Use the `full_join()` function to combine the two shapefiles where you match the state and county codes.
b. Choose a state and map it while coloring the counties using the `poverty` variable from the `county` data set.
    
Make sure to adjust your figure widths and heights to avoid distortions or overlapping labels. Once you draw your map, describe your observations.

```{r}
# US Census Bureau 2018 county-level shapefile files (Downloaded)
# source: 
#   https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/
#     time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html
# Downloaded files are included in the zip for for this mini assignment

# load the shapefiles
state_shp <- read_sf("cb_2018_us_state_20m/cb_2018_us_state_20m.shp")
county_shp <- read_sf("cb_2018_us_county_20m/cb_2018_us_county_20m.shp")
```
