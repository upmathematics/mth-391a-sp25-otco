# Syllabus Reminders

* You must submit your mini-assignment individually by end-of-class or end-of-day. Your name must exist in your mini-assignment and the names of your collaborators.
* Mini-assignments are marked mostly on completion, and partially on correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no detailed feedback on mini-assignments, and no opportunities for revisions and make-up.

# Instructions

* For the exercises, please provide your answers in full sentences.
* Write your answers by replacing the text "[Write your answer here]".
* Please read the problems fully and carefully before answering.
* When finished, knit this `.Rmd` to `.html`.
* Submit this `.Rmd` and the recently knitted `.html`.

# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Problem 4

Visualize the two principal components computed in Problem (1) using three separate scatter plots. In each plot, the points should be colored based on the following categorical variables:

* `species`
* `island`
* `sex`
