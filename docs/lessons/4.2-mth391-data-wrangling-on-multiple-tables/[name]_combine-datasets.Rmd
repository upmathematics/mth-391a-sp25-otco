* Write your answers by replacing the text "[Write your answer here]".
* Please read the problems fully and carefully before answering.
* When finished, knit this `.Rmd` to `.html`.
* Submit this `.Rmd` and the recently knitted `.html`.

# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
```

# Exercises

## Problem 1

Consider the following data frames with information about U.S. states from 1977.

```{r}
statenames <- tibble(names = state.name, twoletter = state.abb)
glimpse(statenames)
```

```{r}
statedata <- tibble(
  names = state.name, 
  income = state.x77[, 2], 
  illiteracy = state.x77[, 3]
  )
glimpse(statedata)
```

Join the two data frames by matching the states.

## Problem 2

Use the `Batting`, `Pitching`, and `People` tables in the `Lahman` package to answer the following questions. Here, you may need to use verbs from the `dplyr` package along with `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, or `right`_join()`.

a. Name every player in baseball history who has accumulated at least 300 home runs (`HR`) and at least 300 stolen bases (`SB`). You can find the first and last name of the player in the `People` data frame. Join this to your result along with the total home runs and total bases stolen for each of these elite players.

b. Similarly, name every pitcher in baseball history who has accumulated at least 300 wins (`W`) and at least 3,000 strikeouts (`SO`).

c. Identify the name and year of every player who has hit at least 50 home runs in a single season. Which player had the lowest batting average in that season?
