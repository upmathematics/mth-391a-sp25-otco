# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(nycflights23)
```

# Exercises

## Problem 1

What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates? Explain why.

```{r}
ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
```

## Problem 2

For each of the following dates and times, show how you would process it using the date-time specification functions to convert it into date/time format.

```{r}
d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
t1 <- "1705"
t2 <- "11:15:10.12 PM"
```

## Problem 3

This problem uses the following merged data from the `nycflights13` and `nycflights23` packages.

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# bind the two data frames
flights <- nycflights13::flights %>% 
  rbind(nycflights23::flights)
```

Using the `flights` data frame, create a subset of flights that departed between November 12 and December 24 for both years 2013 and 2023.
