# Syllabus Reminders

* You must submit your mini-assignment individually by end-of-class or end-of-day. Your name must exist in your mini-assignment and the names of your collaborators.
* Mini-assignments are marked mostly on completion, and partially on correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no detailed feedback on mini-assignments, and no opportunities for revisions and make-up.

# Instructions

* For the exercises, please provide your answers in full sentences.
* Write your answers by replacing the text "[Write your answer here]".
* Please read the problems fully and carefully before answering.
* When finished, knit this `.Rmd` to `.html`.
* Submit this `.Rmd` and the recently knitted `.html`.

# Packages

The following R packages have already been loaded for you, so there's no need to load them yourselfâ€”they will be used in the problem sets. If you need any additional packages, you can load them here as well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)

# text related packages
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)

# Exercises

## Problem 1

Below is an R code chunk that load the data set `avatar-the-last-airbender.csv` file. The file [`avatar-the-last-airbender.csv`](https://github.com/averyrobbins1/appa){target="_blank"} contains transcripts of all three seasons of the show "Avatar: Last Airbender".

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load the stopwords lexicon
swd_list <- tidytext::stop_words %>% 
  filter(lexicon == "SMART") %>%
  select(word)
swd_list <- swd_list$word

# sentiment lexicon
emotions_2 <- tidytext::sentiments # positive/negative words
emotions_10 <- tidytext::get_sentiments(lexicon=c("nrc")) # 10 emotions

# load the data
atla <- read_csv("avatar-the-last-airbender.csv")
```

Below is an R code that takes a subset of the `atla` data frame where it chooses two characters and tokenizes the words in the `character_words` variable while grouping them by `book` and `character` variables. Your task is to modify the code as listed below:
    
a. Include two other characters, and remove the stopwords.
b. Choose the positive and negative words in the `emotions_2` data frame and use it to subset the previous data frame. Hint: Use the `left_join()` function.
c. Create a standardized stacked barplot that compares the proportion of positive and negative words for each character in each book. Write a paragraph describing your observations.
d. Create a word cloud for each character and color each word according to its corresponding sentiment.

```{r}
atla_sub <- atla %>% 
  # pick characters
  filter(character %in% c("Aang","Zuko")) %>%
  # group by book and character
  group_by(book,character) %>%
  # tokenize the character's words and put it into the word variable
  unnest_tokens(word,character_words) %>%
  # count the words
  count(word)
```

## Problem 2

Repeat the same process as Problem (1) but use the `emotions_10` lexicon.

a. How many emotions are included in the lexicon? What are they?
b. Create a standardized stacked barplot that compares the word proportions of your chosen 3 emotions for each chosen character in each book. Write a paragraph describing your observations.
c. Create a word cloud for each character and color each word according to its corresponding sentiment.
